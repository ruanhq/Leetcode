#Build a serialized tree like pmml:


#logistic regression model feature importance?
#1. Permutation importance
#2. Average marginal contribution

#For an agnostic model, how to quantify the feature importance?
#1. permutation importance: investigate the decreas of AUC/ Precision/ Recall etc...
#2. Works better for feed-forward neural network -> shuffling importance/ permutation importance.

pca derivation:

(X^t * X)^{-1} = U Sigma V^T
Principal components, rotation matrix, scores ->
standardized the data matrix.
